Coffee Journey in Romania: Management System

This program is designed for a Romanian coffee shop chain to streamline its business operations across five cities: Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca, Timișoara, Iași, and Brașov. Key features include:

Employee Management: Create classes for different roles (Barista, Manager, Waiter) to add, delete, and schedule employees efficiently.
Inventory and Product Management: Handle stock for ingredients and products, calculate costs, and track daily profits.
Order Processing and Pricing: Process customer orders, compute total costs, and offer discounts for loyal customers.
Event Planning: Organize special events (e.g., coffee tastings) and estimate associated costs.
Reporting: Generate daily financial reports covering revenue, expenses, salaries, and profits.
The program utilizes OOP principles (Classes, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, etc.) and Design Patterns, ensuring maintainable and scalable code. CSV files are used for data storage and can be imported/exported in both Romanian and English.
